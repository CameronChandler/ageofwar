Avoiding stale mates
- Rock Paper Scissors elements
    - Ranged counters slow heavy
    - Heavy counter fast melee
    - Melee counters Ranged
    - Probably just better to have distinct units and work on balancing
- Power scaling - player who evolves first has big advantage and chance to win at each Evolution
- Powers should be really good to give player who skillfully uses at right time a big advantage
- Endless turret upgrade with longer and longer range until reaches enemy base?
- Random damage/defense?
- Sudden death mechanic with gradual health loss?
- Allow XP advantage to snowball - what else can be gained from advantages in cash/xp to quickly end game?
    - Expensive OP troops/turrets?


####
Turrets should be part of bases (so when bases disappear so do turrets)
- This means that bases should call draw on turrets
But bullets should be owned directly by the object manager
